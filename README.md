# What are the main characteristics which have the most impact on the car price?

**Part One: Exploratory Data Analyis**
In this project, we will explore several methods to see if certain characteristics or features can be used to predict car price.

**Part Two: Model Development**
We will develop several models that will predict the price of the car using the variables or features. This is just an estimate but should give us an objective idea of how much the car should cost.

Some questions we want to ask in this module:
* do I know if the dealer is offering fair value for my trade-in?
* do I know if I put a fair value on my car?

In Data Analytics, we often use Model Development to help us predict future observations from the data we have. A Model will help us understand the exact relationship between different variables and how these variables are used to predict the result.

**Part Three: Model Evaluation and Refinement**
Now we have built models and made predictions of vehicle prices. This part of the project determines how accurate these predictions are.
